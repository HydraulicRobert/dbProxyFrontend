this react frontend provides a secure dashboard for the [backend](https://github.com/HydraulicRobert/NotificationAPI), currently allowing a monitoring tool for the notifications.

## Requirements

install the required packages using
```shell
npm install
```

start the frontend using 
```shell
npm run start
```

make sure the url and port for the backend are set in the file variables/weburl.txt. it'll be read by the frontend and used to connect to it
the file content should look like this
```shell
http://<backend ip>:<backend port>
```
an example would be
```shell
http://192.168.0.123:80
```

-access the frontend using the frontend pc's ip and port, ip:5173.
